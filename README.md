# PART 2:<br>
In order to build and run this code, sklearn, pandas, tabulate, itertools, and matplotlib must be installed in order to utilize the library functions. No files need to be downloaded to run the code. The dataset is being hosted on github from the following link: https://github.com/faiza-rahman/ML-HW2-data/blob/main/pendigits2.csv

Libraries used:<br>
sklearn, pandas, tabulate, itertools, matplotlib

In our code, there is a warning that outputs when we run our code:<br>
"future warning: the frame.append method is depricated and will be removed from pandas in a future version"
This warning does impact the output of the code, but may need to be fixed if pandas is updated in the future.
