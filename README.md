# PART 2:<br>
In order to build and run this code, sklearn, pandas, tabulate, itertools, and matplotlib must be installed in order to utilize the library functions.

Libraries used:<br>
sklearn, pandas, tabulate, itertools, matplotlib

In our code, there is a warning that outputs when we run our code:<br>
"future warning: the frame.append method is depricated and will be removed from pandas in a future version"
This warning does impact the output of the code, but may need to be fixed if pandas is updated in the future.
